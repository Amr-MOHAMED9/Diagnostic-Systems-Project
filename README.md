# Diagnostic Systems for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

In this project, [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) was used to build a breast cancer benign/malignant classifier model.[Carsten Eickhoff 2016](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2594776.2594788?casa_token=GMtjoBep2nkAAAAA:7n4D47l-D5yDvNTHgw8KBqQwQd03KuJnYy3hXhBTKqv940MklIJFSsM0wuF4JA1wnL0qv3K3YDp_7g) paper was used to gain some domain expertise to help in understanding the physical differences between a benign and a malignant tumor. Moreover,  the interpretability problem was tackled in detail by using 3 predictor models with 3 different levels of interpretability.
