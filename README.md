# Diagnostic Systems for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

In this project, we will be using the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) to build a breast cancer benign/malignant classifier model. We are going to us [Carsten Eickhoff 2016](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2594776.2594788?casa_token=GMtjoBep2nkAAAAA:7n4D47l-D5yDvNTHgw8KBqQwQd03KuJnYy3hXhBTKqv940MklIJFSsM0wuF4JA1wnL0qv3K3YDp_7g) paper to gain some domain expertise to help us understand the physical differences between a benign and a malignant tumor. Moreover, we are going to tackle the interpretability problem in detail by using 3 predictor models with 3 different levels of interpretability.
